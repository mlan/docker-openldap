#### Seeding the config database

Files with names ending with either `.ldif` or `.sh` in the `LDAP_SEEDDIR0` directory will be applied when the container is run for the first time when there is no config database.
The `*.ldif` files will be applied to the database by using slapadd and `*.sh` files will be sourced.

Files in the `LDAP_SEEDDIR0` directory are ignored when a config database is present.

If no `.ldif` or `.sh` files can be found in the `LDAP_SEEDDIR0` directory during seeding the files matching `LDAP_SEEDDIRa/0-*` will be moved here and applied.
